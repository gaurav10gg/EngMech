This repository contains two fully-implemented C programs developed for the CE2001 – Engineering Mechanics assignment from NIT Puducherry. The assignment includes analytical computation, geometry-based reasoning, and final plotting/visualization as required in the problem statement.

 Question 1 — Centroid of a Composite Shape

A composite planar area is constructed using:
Rectangle 1
Rectangle 2
Right-angled Triangle
All shapes are connected edge-to-edge and must be solved using analytical formulas only, without library functions.

✔ Program Features
Computes geometric parameters from the student roll number
Calculates
Areas of each shape
Individual centroids
Orientation-dependent triangle centroid (base up / base down)
Overall centroid using the weighted average formula
100% compliant with assignment rules
No symbolic/math libraries used

Question 2 — Moment of Inertia of a Composite I-Section

The I-section consists of:
Top flange (rectangle)
Web (rectangle)
Bottom flange (rectangle)
Dimensions are again generated from the student roll number.

✔ Program Features
Computes areas of all components
Determins the centroidal depth of the I-section
Computes Iₓₓ about the centroidal axis using:
Individual centroidal MOIs
Parallel Axis Theorem
Supports vertical flipping of the section

Outputs:
Total area
Centroid position
Final moment of inertia
